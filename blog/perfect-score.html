        <h1>The overachiever's delight: my first Perfect Score</h1>
        <h3>22 May 2023</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst in Sydney on a work trip last week, I had this gut feeling
          while fetching a coffee that I should check my Coder Academy emails...
          just in case. And when I logged in, I didn't believe my eyes. A
          perfect score... my first ever perfect score.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set the scene, a mere few weeks ago I was feeling incredibly
          stressed. I didn't feel like I <em>got</em> Python, at least to the
          level that I needed for this final assignment of the term. And heck,
          even my friend who is a Head of Data at a tech company was telling me
          that my app idea was ambitious, and that if I tried his app idea
          instead I could have punched it out in a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually my app was working, I had built all my features! The final
          hurdle was testing... and boy oh boy, was it a wake-up call. Either my
          tests were failing, or I couldn't even begin to write a test for a
          function because of everything else going on inside it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I take Friday off work to put my head down and get these tests
          working. I spent hours glued to my computer and feel like I'm getting
          nowhere. I pluck up the courage to ask for help on Discord, and the
          response only discourages me further. Just over 48 hours until the
          submission is due and I feel defeated. I go to the gym and out for
          dinner with some friends, and reassure myself that tomorrow is a new
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Saturday, something clicks. I manage to process the advice I
          received on Discord and with a clear head have the realisation - my
          code may be DRY and my app may be functional, but these functions are
          simply <em>TOO BIG!</em> And so the great refactor begins... I tear
          apart every function into anywhere from 2-5 new functions. I create
          another class so I can retain and set a few key variables between the
          different functions. And then over the course of about 8 hours, I
          manage to go from 2 basic test cases to 7 tests, most with multiple
          cases. It's working, I'm getting it!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next morning, I wake with purpose - it's the final stretch. Time
          to smash out my documentation and call it a day. I even get to enjoy a
          few hours out with my friends in the afternoon, which felt delightful
          after being glued to my computer for the previous 2 days. I proudly
          submit, knowing I've comfortably covered the requirements - but
          accepting that there is always room for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term break came at a perfect time, as I had a work trip to Sydney
          which I knew would be a challenge to balance with study. I check my
          student emails on Monday afternoon before my trip - nothing new. I
          don't keep these emails logged in on my phone, and I'm not really
          expecting to get my marks back until I return to Melbourne anyway. But
          on that brisk Wednesday morning before a busy day with my team, my gut
          tells me to login. And there I see the email - "Assignment Marked". I
          hold my breath as I click the link to login to our student platform.
          All I want is an HD, just an HD please...
        </p>
        <p>
          100.5/100.5 - there it is. I'm shocked and think my eyes are fooling
          me so I click into the details and scroll, expecting to see
          constructive feedback. Instead, I see every HD section in the rubric
          highlighted, without a single point deducted. I'm speechless!
          Naturally, I message my Head of Data friend just to tell him that my
          ambitious idea worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does this mean that I love Python and really want to focus my career
          on that? Honestly, it feels too soon to say. But this assignment
          taught me that in a world where you're planning an idea and all its
          features while also being the one to do all the coding and testing -
          go with what you know and/or love. My idea was ambitious but it was
          much easier to visualise because I was inspired by my sport and an
          existing website. In reality unless you're a one-person-band - you'll
          have Product Managers planning your features, Project Managers
          organising your deliverables, Team Leads to help plan increments and
          assign tickets... I won't have to do it all, and that's the way I like
          it.
