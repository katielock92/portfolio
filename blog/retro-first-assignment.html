        <h1>Retrospective: my first Coder Academy assignment</h1>
        <h3>13 April 2023</h3>
        <p>
          It's done. My first assignment. Mixed emotions: relief, satisfaction,
          pride, frustration, stress - it's all there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought this would be the "easy one" - I mean for starters, I had
          created a very similar site for my scholarship application in a
          similar timeframe! And that was all self-taught and without the
          guidance of instructors to teach me best practice. And yet that didn't
          even seem to be matter - I wanted this to be bigger, I wanted this to
          be <em>better.</em> I wanted to prove my worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crushing weight of my own expectations was honestly the hardest
          part. I had to remember - I'm still learning. It doesn't have to be
          perfect. Heck, I can even keep changing and improving it whenever I
          want after the submission so that it's constantly evolving - how cool
          is that!
        </p>
        <p>
          It's now 12 days after submission and I just received my mark back -
          55.5/60. That's a <em>HIGH DISTINCTION!</em> I should be proud. And I
          am! But this assignment wasn't without it's challenges, that's for
          sure. Here's a retro on some of the things that this assignment taught
          me...
        </p>
        <h4>Presentations aren't my strength...</h4>
        <p>
          I have the gift of the gab and can make an excellent slide deck. My
          problem? Struggling to fit in everything I want to express and share,
          without stumbling over my words or going over time. Working remote for
          the last three years and learning to unmask my neurodivergencies
          haven't aided me in this task either... So what can I do, when
          presentations are going to be part of my future career in software?
          Firstly, even if I am often excellent at working under time
          pressure... don't leave recording your presentation until the
          submission date. I'm looking at you, ADHD...
        </p>
        <p>
          I've glanced ahead at the requirements of our upcoming assignments
          and can see there's more presentations looming in the future, so I
          certainly want to be more mindful about when I attempt to record my
          presentation next time, so that I feel calm and prepared, and can
          workshop the delivery.
        </p>
        <h4>Commit early, commit often</h4>
        <p>
          Something that I admit took me a little too long to get my head around
          was how often you should commit to GitHub when working on your local
          machine. My commits ending up coming in batches every few days with
          pretty meaningless descriptions about what changes I actually made.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I hope to get more comfortable with going forward is committing
          straight from VSCode, rather than having to open up the Terminal app
          for my commits. One step at a time I guess...
        </p>
        <h4>Semantics and accessibility can <em>always</em> be better</h4>
        <p>
          While I did put a lot of effort into my semantics and accessibility,
          this ended up being an area that I lost the most marks on my
          assignment - which goes to show how there are so many lenses to
          consider when it comes to best practice.
        </p>
        <h4>So, what next?</h4>
        <p>
          I've already implemented a change for one of the pieces of feedback I
          received that was a really simple fix, and I plan to revisit and make
          adjustments to my site based on the remainder of the feedback. The
          biggest one to consider is in relation to the colour scheme not having
          enough contrast on some pages, which will involve having to update my
          colour palette slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my portfolio site, I'm now deep into learning Python and have
          my first Workbook assignment due next weekend. The assignment features
          a mixture of "intro to web" research questions, written questions on
          features of Python, and problem-solving questions using a combination
          of Python code, pseudocode and flowcharts. Always learning new things
          at the moment!
