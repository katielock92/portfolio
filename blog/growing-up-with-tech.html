        <h1>Growing up with tech - the millennial experience</h1>
        <h3>29 March 2023</h3>
        <p>
          I was born in 1992, which firmly places me as a millennial - despite a
          few pieces of Gen Z lingo occasionally slipping into my vocabulary. My
          exact year of birth however places me into a rare stage where only
          those who were born within a mere few years either side of me had the
          exact same technology at pivotal moments of their adolescence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being a "digital native" and being incredibly comfortable with
          technology before I was even a legal adult, I still have significant
          usage and memory of older technology from earlier in my childhood. As
          I enter into my career transition into tech, I thought it would be
          timely (and hilarious) to reflect on some of these technology memories
          that now feel incredibly <em>dated</em>, yet felt perfectly normal at
          the time.
        </p>
        <h4>Floppy discs</h4>
        <p>
          Before the cloud, before even USB sticks... floppy discs were our file
          sharing/portable storage of choice. I vividly remember my excitement
          when my parents bought me a 5-pack of brightly-coloured floppy discs
          in middle school when it was on the stationary list for our IT class.
          We would pack these chunky discs with us to insert into our computer
          and store a <em>whopping</em> 1.4MB of data - typically used on our MS
          Word, PowerPoint or Paint "projects". My masterpiece of work stored on
          this in Year 8 was a "stop-motion" animation created in MS Paint and
          Movie Maker, despite my terrible artistic skills.
        </p>
        <h4>Dial-up internet</h4>
        <p>
          "Muuuuum get off the phone, I need to go on MSN!" - a commonly heard
          phrase in the early 2000's. Our internet shared a line with our home
          phone which meant only one could be used at a time (and this is before
          the rise of mobile phones too...) My family was late to the party with
          getting broadband internet too, which meant until around 2008, my
          internet time was severely limited and connection speeds were
          terrible. We even kept a logbook of our connection times because our
          internet plan included 20 hours of internet... a month.
        </p>
        <h4>Fax machines</h4>
        <p>
          While still existing in a fleeting number of industries, fax machines
          seem irrelevant with the invention of modern internet technology. But
          for a while they were a key communication staple for when physical
          mail was too slow, but you needed something in writing. This
          printer-meets-telephone machine would start ringing like a phone, then
          whir up and print you something. My family never owned our own one
          except oddly enough in 2011 - because my summer job one year whilst in
          university required one to receive my orders from businesses who still
          relied upon them. The old technology was offset with the excitement of
          seeing an order appear physically in front of my eyes.
        </p>
        <h4>No smartphones</h4>
        <p>
          My first smartphone? Aged 16 or 17 (and it was rubbish too)... and my
          first mobile altogether? I was 12! That might seem wild to younger
          generations, but essentially
          <em>nobody</em> my age had a mobile until we started high school. And
          even then, it was some heavy black-and-white screened Nokia that only
          really allowed you to call, text or play Snake. It was kind of nice to
          have some level of disconnect from your peers, but looking back I
          absolutely <em>love</em> having the internet in my pocket for other
          life benefits. I got my first iPhone at 19 and prior to that, "mobile
          internet" was slow and expensive even on smartphones... meaning
          sometimes getting lost would happen without the convenience of a maps
          app at your fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>Those aren't even <em>all</em> the possible technology throwbacks I could list, but a few core memories that are fun to reflect on üë©üèº‚Äçüíª</p>
