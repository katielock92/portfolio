        <h1>Diversity in Tech Scholarship Submission</h1>
        <h4><em>January 2023</em></h4>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Upon applying for my Coder Academy web development bootcamp, my
          immediate plan was to apply for the
          <a
            href="https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/diversity_in_tech_scholarship/about"
            >Diversity in Tech Scholarship</a
          >. The brief for the scholarship application was quite broad - we had
          to submit a creative portfolio using our choice of media to convey who
          we were, and how we would contribute to increasing diversity in the
          tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that with my submission, I wanted to challenge myself and show
          was I was capable of. I had some previous experience with web
          languages such as HTML and CSS, though this was going to require a lot
          of time and research to successfully deliver my vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of a two week period (around my work and sport
          commitments), I was able to build a basic and deploy a basic website
          from scratch, without formal education in best practice. My
          appreciation of clean, adaptive design ensured that I considered media
          breakpoints from the very beginning and constructed hand-drawn
          wireframes for both mobile and web views. I am also incredibly
          grateful to be surrounded by intelligent and helpful peers, who could
          provide me with tips and assist in testing for any display errors that
          could be cleaned up.
        </p>
        <h4>Skills and technologies used:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Despite repurposing the custom domain for my new portfolio site, I
          have retained the original website to show my growth as a developer:
        </p>

      <div class="buttons">
        <!-- external page set to open in a new window, while going back to the portfolio stays within the same window -->
      <button onclick="window.open('diversity-in-tech/index.html','_blank')">View original site →</button>
      <button onclick="window.location.href='../portfolio.html';">Back to portfolio →</button></div>
