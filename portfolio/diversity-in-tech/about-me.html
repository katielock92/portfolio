        <p>One of my biggest strengths (or weaknesses...) is that I find a very diverse range of topics, occupations and hobbies interesting - I can be very good at a LOT of things... if I put my mind to it. My career to date has not taken a traditional path and I don't plan for that to change in the slightest!</p>
        <p>I have had a keen passion in technology since I was a young kid, with my parents expecting that I would study it at university. Unfortunately the attitudes towards careers in tech (especially for women!) were different even a mere 14 years ago, meaning that it was not something I considered studying at university. I did apply (and get accepted!) into a software development bootcamp in 2016 but unfortunately at the time it was only available intensive full-time - something I couldn't manage financially.</p>
        <p>Even outside of work and career considerations, I've had quite an array of hobbies over the years including (not definitely not limited to) live music, netball, playing bass guitar, improv classes, learning Korean, video games, making (and watching) YouTube videos and AFL. </p>
