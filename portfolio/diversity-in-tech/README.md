## A note from future Katie:
Hi! This website is being kept in a new location for archive purposes, but what's this... an updated README.md!

That's right... I want you to know if you found this, that all other files within this folder have remain untouched in order to show my progression and development. I know the code isn't as clean as it could be, but it was my first site so do cut me some slack >.<
