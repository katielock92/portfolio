            <h1>Diversity and my future in tech</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>It's relatively common knowledge that the tech industry (both worldwide and locally in Australia) has a
                significant gender imbalance. In 2021, it was reported that women made up only 29% of employees in the
                technology industry&#185; - compared to 48% in similar occupations in the professional, scientific and
                technical services industries. While it is a bit of a stereotype that software developers are
                introverted, nerdy men who are usually white or Asian - this stereotype has emerged due to a higher
                proportion of these groups existing in tech roles and/or the tech industry as a whole. Part of breaking
                down this stereotype involves increasing the diversity across all areas of tech.</p>
                <div class="graphs"><img class="graphs" src="images/tech sector graph.png"><img class="graphs" src="images/pst sector graph.png"></div>
            <p>There are multiple proven benefits for employers for having a diverse workforce; which the tech industry
                could benefit
                greatly from. These include, but are not limited to: more innovation, new perspectives, a wider talent
                pool and
                better employee performance - all of which can contribute to increased profits&#178;.</p>
            <p>In addition to benefits for employers, increasing diversity in the tech industry also provides a number
                of fantastic opportunities for underrepresented and marginalised groups. While many of us are aware of
                the
                gender pay gap, this impacts people of colour at a higher rate than their white counterparts&#179;. The
                tech industry is well known for typically paying above average salaries, which can provide greater
                financial security for marginalised groups that are typically paid less. Tech roles can commonly provide
                greater flexibility in working hours and locations, which can increase the employee engagement for
                parents and neurodiverse employees in particular.</p>
            <p>When considering diversity in tech, we need to look beyond just gender diversity. A truly diverse
                workforce represents a wide intersection of diverse identities, including gender, sexual orientation,
                cultural background, ethnicity, age, disability, among others&#8308;. If we want the tech industry to be
                an equal playing field and to represent society at large, DE&I initiatives need to consider ways to get
                multiple underrepresented groups into tech, and also ensure that they can thrive once in the industry.
            </p>
           
            <h2>What diverse groups do you represent?</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, increasing diversity in tech goes well beyond the scope of increasing the number of
                women. I represent a few different diverse groups that are typically underpresented in tech:</p>
            <ul class="factors">
                <li class="factors">Gender<section class="factor_description"><br>I am cisgender woman - while the world
                        has come a long way in the last 100+ years, misogyny and the patriachy still impact many facets
                        of my life</section>
                </li>
                <li class="factors">Disability<section class="factor_description"><br>I was diagnosed with ADHD at age
                        29 - a neurological condition which is an invisible diability and is often highly misunderstood
                    </section>
                </li>
                <li class="factors">Sexual Orientation<section class="factor_description"><br>I am proudly bisexual, and
                        choosing to disclose my sexuality can result in both conscious and unconscious discrimination
                    </section>
                </li>
                <li class=factors>Immigrant<section class="factor_description"><br>I migrated to Australia in 2014 and
                        became a citizen in 2021 - I am priviledged that my migrant journey was significantly easier than
                        most, but it was not without sacrfice</section>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's also important to note that diversity and priviledge is not a competition - the key reason for
                elevating these is to recognise that some groups are not always given a seat at the table, or an equal
                shot to earn that seat.</p>
            <h2>What will you do to promote diversity once in the tech industry?</h2>
            <p>Getting a seat at the table isn't enough for me - I want to give others a helping hand to get there too.
                I plan to document my journey to becoming a software develop with the hope of inspiring others from
                underrepresented groups to consider a career in tech. Once I am technically confident and capable in my
                own coding skills, I plan to be involved in some form
                of mentorship program designed at helping aspiring software developers from underrepresented groups in
                tech. I currently am working in a HR role and I plan to use my understanding and experience in HR to be
                a loud supporter of DE&I initiatives in my future workplace.</p>
